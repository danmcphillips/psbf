								<h3>Gamma Line</h3>
								<span class="image left"><a href="http://gammafishing.com/"><img src="images/gamma.png" alt="" /></span></a>
								<p>Black Knight Industries, Inc. was founded by Dale and Heidi Black in September 2010 and purchased the fishing division of Gamma Technologies in November 2010. </p>
								<p>Black Knight Industries is a small family owned business located in Oil City, Pennsylvania. Oil City is in the Northwest portion of the state about an hour and 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh and an hour and 20 minutes south of Erie. </p>
								<p>Nestled around the Allegheny River, the area has many opportunities for outdoorsman. We have many trout fishing streams, some stocked and some that are full of native brookies. We have lakes loaded with bluegill, perch, walleye, bass and musky. We even have lakes that have landlocked stripers. Then there is my favorite, the Allegheny River, where I fish for smallmouth, walleye, musky, catfish and carp. </p>
								<p>I look forward to matching my experience as a fisherman to the production/marketing of Gamma and Frog Hair lines. When a new company takes over there are normally changes that occur. I want to reassure you that there will be no changes in the product quality. It is very important to us to maintain the high standards that Gamma Technologies established in their products. </p>
								<p>Gamma Technologies will still be involved, as a sub-contractor, treating the line with their proprietary process. This process is what gives Frog Hair and Gamma the qualities we all have become used to. That is why I, myself use it and why I pursued the purchase of Gamma's fishing division.</p>
